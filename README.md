As an Aussie who's made the move to the United States I've put together a guide of useful infomation.

# Basics

**E3 Visa:**

- LCA (form your employer fills in to prove they're a real company)
- Visa Application & Interview (Total wait/line time may be hours but interview time may only be a few minutes)
- Proof of speciality job & Supporting Documents
- Past employment history
- Academic Transcript for University Degree

The allocated number of E3 Visa's should mean there's always availability for Aussies coming to the US on an E3 Visa (if you meet the requirments).

Timings:
- Once you file expect it to take 1 week for the Department of Labor to certify
- Then it depends on the wait time in AUS (~3 weeks to get an interview as of June 2019)
- Then you have to wait for your Visa to be returned (~ 1 week or less)

Once you have your Visa you're good to travel to the US, go ahead and book your flight!

**Employer:**

- Background check
- Employment contract
- Letter from employer/HR verifying employment

**Insurance:**

Health Insurance is very different in the US.

You should ask your Employer what insurance they provide. Generally in the US you pay out of pocket for all things healthcare, but if your employer has insurance after a certian amount per year (e.g $3,000) you will only need to pay a small amount (e.g 20%) of all health fees.

**Employment Eligibility Verification:**

There is nothing in particular you need to do prior to arrival, but after your U.S. entry, you will need to download your I-94 from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website: https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/. You will need your I-94 to complete the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, to commence your U.S. employment with Contino.


**Social Security Number:**

https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10096.pdf

Apply for this ASAP when you touch down. You can visit in person by just walking in with your passport and a mailing address. It should take 10 days to get your social security number and you'll walk away with a letter proving you've gone one on the way.

**Bank:**

If you've got proof of employment (ie employment contract) and ID (Passport/Drivers Licence) as well as an Address where you'll be living you should be able to get a bank account on the spot in some banks.

As an Aussie/International consider banks like HSBC, Citibank that have a presense outside of the US and if possible have a corresponding account with the Australian counterpart (this isn't required for joining but may still convienent and can't hurt).

In America they have transacitonal accounts called **'cheque'** accounts where your pay will go (you'll need give your employer your account and routing number), and these accounts are where you'll take out cash from ATMs.

You'll also get a **'saving'** account that you can transact up to 6 times per month (so consider it where you monthly savings would go).

Major Banks:

- Bank of America
- TDA
- Wells Fargo

# Mobile Phone in AU

Consider porting your number to a cheap prepaid service so keep it active for minimal cost (up to 1 year credit).

Remember some servies will require an AU number to login, like the MyGov ATO Service.

# Mobile Phone in US

https://fi.google.com/account

You can use Google Fi for your mobile phone/sms/data. This works in the US **and* roaming around the world.

To keep things simple you can signup in the US, but for those that want to hit the ground running...

Steps you can do while still in Australia:

- Have a compatible device - e.g Google Pixel
- Register for Google Fi using your regular Google Account
- Download a VPN Service like Proton so it can appear like you're coming from USA (for play store download)
- Create a **new** Google Account, sign-in on your phone, and open the play store (all while using USA VPN) - This will allow you to download Google Fi (the sole purpoose of this account is to download apps from the US play store WITHOUT having to change your existing Google account and risk losing apps or not being able to download Aussie apps in the future - You do **NOT** need to use this Google account for any other purpose)
- In theory you should be able to registery using 'virtual sim' in Australia - but I found I needed and actual sim, and I needed to be in the US
- Incase virtual sim does not work: Have Google Fi sim shipped somewhere save in USA waiting for you (ie work or hotel)

Steps in USA:

- Put sim in phone
- Open Google Fi App and click next
- Enjoy life

# Where to live

Coliving options are great when you're starting out. They come fully furnished, have one simple bill and include things like Internet, Electricity, Weekly cleaning etc.

They also give you the opportunity to meet people (your house mates) as well as weekly social events with more of a community/curated vibe.

They tend to have easier signup process and terms which is a stress relief when you first land in the US.

Outposts offer terms from 1 month so you can land and explore: https://outpost-club.com/new-york (Memberships from 1 month + Great because they allow for 1 Month stay - could be good for getting your bearings)

Other's worth adding to your list:

- https://www.common.com/
- https://www.roomrs.co/apartments?&loc=manhattan&min=1700&max=2300 (Roomrs - Smart Living & Communuity Events - Social aspect seems appealing)
- https://new-york.goquarters.com/nyc/ (Quarters - Have 1BR Options and have options in NYC)

WeLive is the 'WeWorks' version of co-living, but much more like a hotel. It's worth a look if you need somewhere to live for less than a month: https://www.welive.com/ (But also consider AirBnB for short term).

Brooklyn is worth checking out, especially the suburbs closest to Manhattan.


## Location Review:

20 Minute Walk to Midtown

+ Midtown East:  More corporate, less expensive, many of the NYC chain restaurants/cafes are popping up here. Access to a few different subway lines.

+ Murray Hill/Kips Bay: Has a reputation of where the bros live.  There is a sportsbar nightlife here.  There are decent restaurants, many grocery stores, and reasonably priced rentals that are decent sized.  There is a mix of walk-ups and doorman buildings.

+ Hells Kitchen: It tends to attract a lot of tourists since it is near times square.

+ Chelsea:  A dynamic area. there is a lot going on here.  Each block brings something different.  There are lots of good subways in this area.

20 minute subway ride to Midtown

+ Greenwich Village/West Village:  There is a nightlife here with smaller bougie restaurants/bars.  It is very expensive and your money won't get you a lot of space.  It's where a lot of trendy famous people live.

+ Gramercy:  This area is similar to Kips Bay/Murray Hill it is just further south.  And it happens to be where I live!  There is minimal nightlife but you are closer to the East Village and can walk downtown and uptown very easily.  It is moderately priced as well.

+ Tribeca:  A trendy area, the apartments are generally all lofts.  It is a little removed from the island so can make it more challenging to get to any part of the city.  But it's a cool spot.  There aren't many grocery stores/retail here.  But you can do all of that online!

+ Financial District:  This has become a popular area to live because the buildings are newer and the prices are less expensive.  There isn't a nightlife here... maybe a few bars.  And it's pretty dead on the weekends since it's very corporate but during the week lots of life.

There is a lot of nightlife on the Lower East Side and East Village of Manhattan.  Although, to be honest, the whole island has something for everyone.  The west side has the bigger clubs (Chelsea) and the Upper East Side has more preppy sports bars.
